## VULNERABILITIES VS BUGS

We classify vulnerabilities as a type of bug which pose a security threat to the device or device owner running

Bugs should be reported via the issues tab, while vulnerabilities should be reported privately to an administrator,

where you should navigate to `#ticket-tool` and raise a ticket.
