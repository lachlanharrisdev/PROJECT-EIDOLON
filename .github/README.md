<br/>

Project Eidolon is a decentralised suite of OSINT tools built to analyze the evolution of political disinformation on social media. 

In it's default configuration, Eidolon uses clever keyword rotation to scrape popular social media networks (primarily Twitter/X) 
for posts about major political entities, identifies opinionated posts coming from potential bot accounts, and tracks these accounts towards botnets to identify organisations running unethical political propaganda schemes. 

<br/>

> ### **EIDOLON**
> #### *Noun* ● /ʌɪˈdəʊlɒn/
> In ancient Greek literature, an eidolon is a spirit-image of a living or dead person; a shade or phantom 'look-alike' of the human form.

# // OVERVIEW

Eidolon is completely module-based, meaning all of the actual functionality is easily modifiable, removable & distributable, without causing any errors. The suite comes pre-loaded with modules that cover all of the functionality that most people would need, but for those who need maximum extensibility or connections with other applications, then this has been built for you.

<br/>

## // FEATURES

- **ENTIRELY MODULE-BASED**
    - Default modules are verified based on a key-pair-based signed hash generator
    - Modules communicate via a universal message bus
    - Modules specify any number of inputs & outputs, and automatically subscribe to matching outputs from other modules
    - Modules each have their own `.yaml` file for configuration
    - All core functionality (beyond module management, security & logging) is stored in modules, making it easy to remove unnecessary functionality
- **DYNAMIC KEYWORD GENERATION** *\[via keyword_monitor module\]*
    - Keywords are updated regularly in real-time based on trending political news articles
    - Political entities are identified & classified via NLP
    - Keywords are transmitted on the message bus for any module to subscribe to
- **PRODUCTION-READY LOGGING**
    - Console logging has been standardised across modules
    - Logging has a fully customisable format, including colours, text decoration & variables
    - All logs are saved into a persistent `.logs/` folder
 
<br/>

## // DEFAULT MODULES

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Keyword Monitor | Scrapes RSS feeds for popular political news articles, then uses NLP to identify political entities |

# // GETTING STARTED

To get started with contributing, please read [contributing.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) & the [code of conduct](/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## REQUIREMENTS
- Python 3.12 (specifically tested on `3.12.10`)

**Optional:**

- Docker CLI
- Python Environment via venv
- High-speed internet connection
<br/>

## INSTALLATION

### MANUAL SETUP

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lachlanharrisdev/project-eidolon.git
cd project-eidolon
```

2. Set up a virtual environment \[Recommended\]:]

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Setup your environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Now edit .env with your actual API credentials
```

<br/>

### DOCKER

1. Build the full Docker image

```bash
docker build -f docker/full_build.Dockerfile -t eidolon .
```

2.1 To run in CLI mode:

```bash
docker run -it --env-file .env eidolon python main.py
```

2.2 To run in API mode:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env eidolon python main.py --mode api
```

<br/>

# // USAGE

## CLI MODE

```bash
python main.py
```

## API MODE

```bash
python main.py --mode api
```

API launches at http://localhost:8000 with:

    GET / → Root endpoint

    GET /health → System health check

## PROJECT STRUCTURE

```explorer
core/            # detection logic, signal analysis, filtering
ingest/          # data pipelines for each platform
interface/       # CLI and API entrypoints
data/            # persistent storage (autogenerated)
tests/           # unit and integration tests
modules/         # modules that are loaded when running main.py
```

## RUNNING TESTS

This project uses `pytest` for testing. Major modules & every individual module uses tests to ensure code quality. All test files begin with the prefix `test_`, as per the [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html).

To run all the tests in the project locally before creating a pull request, run the following in the project directory:

```
pytest
```

You can run all tests within a specific directory using:
```
pytest <dir>/

# e.g. Run all of the tests for loaded modules
pytest modules/
```

For more info, refer to the [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html)
