# // PROJECT EIDOLON

![Banner](/.github/images/Banner_2x1.jpg)

Project Eidolon is a modular suite of decentralised OSINT tools designed to analyze the evolution of disinformation, mainly in a political context. Eidolon uses clever keyword rotation to scrape popular social media networks (primarily Twitter/X) for posts about major political entities, and tracks accounts towards botnets to identify organisations running unethical political propaganda schemes.

Project Eidolon isn't just a toolset. It's a **philosophy**:  
> That the internet should prioritize **human rights over profit**, **truth over traction**, and **transparency over trickery**

If you believe the web should be a safe place for people to connect, not a tool for political propaganda, then you're already one of us.


# // OVERVIEW

Eidolon passively scans public online chatter surrounding **political topics** and **cultural flashpoints**. It flags **inauthentic behavior**, tracks **sentiment over time**, and maps out **influence operations** with eerie precision.

All of this is done using:
- Adaptive bot detection algorithms
- Multi-platform ingestion pipelines
- Real-time and batch analytics
- Human-readable interfaces (CLI + API)

## // FEATURES

- Cross-platform social media monitoring (Twitter/X, Reddit, Facebook)
- Dynamic keyword rotation based on customiseable RSS feeds
- Modular bot detection algorithms (with pluggable strategies)
- Disinformation pattern analysis
- Data persistence and querying
- CLI + API interfaces for full control
- Built as Python modules for clean integration
- Docker-ready
- Cross-platform capable

# // GETTING STARTED

## REQUIREMENTS
- Python 3.12 (specifically tested on `3.12.10`)

## INSTALLATION

### MANUAL SETUP

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lachlanharrisdev/project-eidolon.git
cd project-eidolon
```

2. Set up a virtual environment \[Recommended\]:]

```
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Setup your environment

```
cp .env.example .env
# Now edit .env with your actual API credentials
```

### DOCKER

1. Build the full Docker image

```
docker build -f docker/full_build.Dockerfile -t eidolon .
```

2.1 To run in CLI mode:

```
docker run -it --env-file .env eidolon python -m app.main
```

2.2 To run in API mode:

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env eidolon python -m app.main --mode api
```

# // USAGE

## CLI MODE

```
python -m app.main
```

## API MODE

```
python -m app.main --mode api
```

API launches at http://localhost:8000 with:

    GET / → Root endpoint

    GET /health → System health check

    POST /twitter/search → Query Twitter

    POST /reddit/search → Query Reddit

# // THE MISSION

This is just the beginning. Eidolon will evolve — as propaganda does. The methods will change. The truth will stay the same.

Help us build a system that resists the commodification of reality. Contribute code. Fork the project. Share the mission. Start discussions. Name and shame bots.

    Project Eidolon is not a product. It’s a warning shot.
