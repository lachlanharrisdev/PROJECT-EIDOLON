<br/>
Project Eidolon is a decentralised suite of OSINT tools built to analyze the evolution of political disinformation on social media. Eidolon uses clever keyword rotation to scrape popular social media networks (primarily Twitter/X) 
for posts about major political entities, identifies opinionated posts coming from potential bot accounts, and tracks these accounts towards botnets to identify organisations running unethical political propaganda schemes. 
<br/>
We believe Project Eidolon isn't just a toolset. It's a **philosophy**:  

> That the internet should prioritize **human rights over profit**, **truth over traction**, and **transparency over trickery**

If you believe the web should be a safe place for people to connect, not a tool for political propaganda, then you're already one of us.

<br/>

# // OVERVIEW

Eidolon passively scans public online chatter surrounding political topics and cultural flashpoints based off of current trending news articles. Keywords are extracted using NLP, which are fed into scrapers for popular social media platforms. These scrapers track posts from low-standing accounts, and using some experimental detection methods, identifies whether these accounts are parts of larger botnets.

## // FEATURES

- Cross-platform social media monitoring (Twitter/X, Reddit)
- Dynamic keyword rotation based on customiseable RSS feeds
- Fully-fledged module system extensible on ANY module
- Modular bot detection algorithms
- Disinformation pattern analysis
- Data persistence and querying
- CLI + API interfaces for full control
- Built as Python modules for clean integration
- Docker-ready
- Cross-platform capable

<br/>

# // GETTING STARTED

## REQUIREMENTS
- Python 3.12 (specifically tested on `3.12.10`)

**Optional:**

- Docker CLI
- Python Environment via venv
- High-speed internet connection
<br/>

## INSTALLATION

### MANUAL SETUP

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lachlanharrisdev/project-eidolon.git
cd project-eidolon
```

2. Set up a virtual environment \[Recommended\]:]

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Setup your environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Now edit .env with your actual API credentials
```

<br/>

### DOCKER

1. Build the full Docker image

```bash
docker build -f docker/full_build.Dockerfile -t eidolon .
```

2.1 To run in CLI mode:

```bash
docker run -it --env-file .env eidolon python -m app.main
```

2.2 To run in API mode:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env eidolon python -m app.main --mode api
```

<br/>

# // USAGE

## CLI MODE

```bash
python -m app.main
```

## API MODE

```bash
python -m app.main --mode api
```

API launches at http://localhost:8000 with:

    GET / → Root endpoint

    GET /health → System health check

# // DEVELOPMENT

## PROJECT STRUCTURE

```explorer
core/            # detection logic, signal analysis, filtering
ingest/          # data pipelines for each platform
interface/       # CLI and API entrypoints
data/            # persistent storage (autogenerated)

modules/         # modules that are loaded when running main.py
```

## RUNNING TESTS

This project uses `pytest` for testing. Major modules & every individual module uses tests to ensure code quality. All test files begin with the prefix `test_`, as per the [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html).

To run all the tests in the project locally before creating a pull request, run the following in the project directory:

```
pytest
```

You can run all tests within a specific directory using:
```
pytest <dir>/

# e.g. Run all of the tests for loaded modules
pytest modules/
```

For more info, refer to the [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html)

# // THE MISSION

This is just the beginning. Eidolon will evolve — as propaganda does. The methods will change. The truth will stay the same.

Help us build a system that resists the commodification of reality. Contribute code. Fork the project. Share the mission. Start discussions. Name and shame bots.
